Development news this week:

I joined a new startup community and told them about the project. Discussed with them about the idea and received feedback.

I decided to write articles about the most frequently asked questions about my competitors. Currently working on an article about LinkedIn.

The main problem is still the development of the interface. I realized that an attractive and functional interface is very important for the platform. I decided to analyze sites that use new approaches (WebGL, Three.js) to UX development.
