1) Wrote and published an article about LinkedIn problems: https://medium.com/@xeanora/the-main-problems-of-linkedin-dc3e9bd709e6

2) We came to the conclusion that it is necessary to write a few more articles. We are currently working on the articles "Social networks do not solve the problem of the formation of the environment" and "Problems of searching people"

3) Conducted a discussion with the startup community about the problems of existing products on the market. Now there is a clearer idea of how to present the project to the audience.
