I found a person who is just as interested in creating this project as I am. I hope that in the future we can work together to create a platform. When this happens I will write about it.

A plan for the future has been formed: 
- Present the project to people who may be interested in creating a platform.
- Create a presentation of the project.
- Structure information in the GitHub organization.
- Create a platform interface.
- Think over and describe the operation of a script for collecting information from existing social networks.
