A call was held with a new member of our team. We discussed goals and set tasks. Trello was created: https://trello.com/b/DpXKSrWh/xeanora-project 
I am now actively learning interface development while working on a real project. Therefore, in the next 2-3 months there will be less activity on the project. After its completion, I will start designing the interface for the platform.
